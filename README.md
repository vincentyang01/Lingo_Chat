Slack Translator was originally an idea to create a Slack clone, but transformed into a live translation app. It allows users to select the language they want to translate to and uses an API to detect the language that was entered. The functionality comes with the user not being able to see the translation and other users to see the translation that the original message was typed from. It also detects if the language that the message was typed in is the same as another user's selected language and does not display the translation. There is also a text-to-speech function that is only attached to the original text.

Authentication is with gmail account and this app is written in ReactJS and a Google Cloud Firestore backend.
